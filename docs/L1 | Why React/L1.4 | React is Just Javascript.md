#### React is Just JavaScript  
- Over the past couple of years, functional programming has had a large impact on the JavaScript ecosystem and community.
Functional programming is an advanced topic in JavaScript and fills hundreds of books.
-  React builds on a lot of the techniques of functional programming. However, there are a couple of important JavaScript functions that are vital to functional programming that we should look at.
These are the Array's ```.map()``` and ```.filter()``` methods.

- Two of the main methods that you'll be using quite a lot are: 
- ```.map()```  
- ```.filter()```  
It's important that you're comfortable using these methods, so take some time to practice using them.
Why not look through some of your existing code and try converting your for loops to .map() calls or see if you can remove any if statements by using .filter().
