Components are the buliding blocks of react becoz-  
- They helps us break down UI into smllaer piceses.  
- React Compoments **favor composition over inheritance**.  

#### Favor Composition Over Inheritance  
You might have heard before that it’s better to “favor composition over inheritance”. This is a principle that I believe is difficult to learn today. Many of the most popular programming languages make extensive use of inheritance,
and it has carried over into popular UI frameworks like the Android and iOS SDKs.  

**In contrast, React uses composition to build user interfaces**. Yes, we extend React.Component, but we never extend it more than once.
Instead of extending base components to add more UI or behavior, we compose elements in different ways using nesting and props. You ultimately want your UI components to be independent, focused, and reusable.  
So if you’ve never understood what it means to “favor composition over inheritance” you’ll definitely learn using React!
