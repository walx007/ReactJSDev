#### Scaffolding Your React App  
- JSX is awesome, but it does need to be transpiled into regular JavaScript before reaching the browser. We typically use a transpiler like Babel to accomplish this for us.
We can run Babel through a build tool, like Webpack which helps bundle all of our assets (JavaScript files, CSS, images, etc.) for web projects.  

- To streamline these initial configurations, we can use Facebook's Create React App package to manage all the setup for us! 
This tool is incredibly helpful to get started in building a React app, as it sets up everything we need with zero configuration!
